# ESM 244 Lab4 Nonlinear Least Squares

## Single model NLS
- Creating a fox model, using functions
- Using `equatiomatic`
- Creating nonlinear least squares with sufficient guesses
- Checking number of model iterations

## Using `purr`to run many nls models
- Using .x, .y, and `map` function
- using `nest` to add columns to dataframes which contain stacked model outputs

## Comparing to random null model
- Deriving nullmodel to test different models against 
- Assessing using `rmse` evaluation

## Graphing top 5 best fit models
- `purr` with `cowplot` to build multiple graphs
- Extracting the legend and putting it in a speicifc place on plot output
